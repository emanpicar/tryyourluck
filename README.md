# TryYourLuck

A minigame created for the Guildcon event at Nokia PH and for fun.

  - This minigame is created in a rush and hopefully in my free time I can refactor, improve and make this a proper production ready minigame.
  - Created using golang, js, webpack

# How to run

  - Go to ./client and run "npm run build-dev"
  - Then go to ./server directory and run "go run main.go"
  - Open http://localhost:8080 in the browser
